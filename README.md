# Heart Disease Data Analysis

This project contains a data analysis workflow for a heart disease dataset using SAS Studio. The analysis includes **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **data cleaning**, **transformation**, and **reduction**.

## Dataset

* **Original dataset:** `heartdisease_before.txt` – raw data from Kaggle.
* **Processed dataset:** `heartdisease_after.txt` – cleaned and transformed data.

## Files

* `EDA.txt` – contains code and output for exploratory data analysis.
* `preprocessing.txt` – contains code and output for data cleaning, transformation, and reduction.
* `heartdisease_before.txt` – raw dataset.
* `heartdisease_after.txt` – cleaned and processed dataset.

## Project Workflow

1. Load the raw dataset into SAS Studio.
2. Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand distributions, missing values, and correlations.
3. Apply **data cleaning** to handle missing or inconsistent values.
4. Perform **data transformation and reduction** to prepare the dataset for further modeling or analysis.

## Notes

* Analysis was done using **SAS Studio**.
* No additional packages or requirements are needed to view these `.txt` files.
* For detailed steps, see the `EDA.txt` and `preprocessing.txt` files.
